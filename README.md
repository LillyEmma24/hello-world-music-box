# hello-world-music-box
This is my first GitHub project!! For this project I want to be able to turn a simple melody into a 3D printable music box. You would be able to input note pitch and length and the program would place "dots" on a cylinder at certain coordinates. When the cylinder is put into a music box, it would play the melody!
